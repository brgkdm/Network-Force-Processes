## Guide Overview: Network Security and Scanning Process

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to network security and scanning, focusing on anonymity, passive network monitoring, and information gathering techniques. By following the sections below, you will gain practical knowledge of how to enhance your network security and perform security assessments using common tools. The guide is structured into distinct phases, from securing your network connection to performing passive scans and brute-force attacks for testing vulnerabilities. 

### **1. Anonymity and Security**

Before diving into network scanning and penetration testing, the first step is ensuring your own anonymity and security. Begin by setting up a secure VPN connection and performing a DNS leak test to confirm that your traffic remains private.

- **[VPN and DNS Leak Test.md](https://github.com/brgkdm/process-network-force/blob/main/Anonymity%20and%20Security.md)**  
  This section walks you through the process of setting up a VPN, verifying your IP address security, and checking for potential DNS leaks. Ensuring that your connection is secure and anonymous is a fundamental prerequisite before performing any network reconnaissance or penetration testing.

### **2. Passive Network Monitoring**

Once your connection is secured, itâ€™s time to begin monitoring the network in a passive manner. Passive monitoring allows you to gather information without actively interacting with the network, making it an important stealthy method for reconnaissance.

- **[Passive Network Monitoring.md](https://github.com/brgkdm/process-network-force/blob/main/Passive%20Network%20Monitoring.md)**  
  This section introduces passive network scanning techniques using tools like `airodump-ng` and other monitoring tools. The goal here is to gather valuable insights about the devices on the network, including their MAC addresses, IPs, and other metadata. This is a crucial part of understanding the network layout and preparing for further testing.

### **3. Network Scanning and Information Gathering**

After completing the passive monitoring phase, the next step involves actively scanning the network to gather detailed information about the devices and services running on it. This phase is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited in a security test.

- **[Network Scanning and Information Gathering.md](https://github.com/brgkdm/process-network-force/blob/main/Network%20Scanning%20and%20Information%20Gathering.md)**  
  This section covers various network scanning techniques, including using `nmap` for discovering devices on the network, identifying open ports, and performing vulnerability scans. Additionally, you will learn about brute force attacks and methods for testing the security of devices by attempting default credentials and other common access points.

### **Conclusion: Next Steps and Further Development**

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of securing your network and conducting basic network security assessments. By following the steps outlined in each section, you will gain practical experience with key security tools and techniques. However, it is important to note that network security is a continuously evolving field, and further improvements or modifications may be necessary as new vulnerabilities and attack methods emerge.

**Room for Development:**  
This guide is open to further development and contributions. As security tools and methods evolve, so should this guide. Feel free to contribute new techniques, tools, or insights that can improve this repository.

### **Important Notes:**

- **Penetration Testing and Legal Considerations:**  
  All actions described in this guide are part of penetration testing practices, which are **only legal and ethical when performed on networks or devices you own, have explicit permission to test, or in environments where such testing is authorized (e.g., bug bounty programs)**. Unauthorized penetration testing or scanning of networks can result in **legal consequences, including criminal charges**. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before performing any tests.
  
- **Anonymity and Security:**  
  Anonymity and security are essential, and you should prioritize securing your own environment before attempting any network scans or testing.
